 *    Description:  Struct and accompanying functions that define the API for discovery
 *                  implementations. The whisper-core comes with pre-canned strategies
 *                  for discovering peers on the LAN and across the LAN boundaries, but
 *                  users can implement their own in the shared libraries and load them
 *                  at run time.
